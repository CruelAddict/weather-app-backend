# weather-app-backend

You'll need to have NodeJS and MongoDB installed on your device for this server to run.

Steps for mac users:

Open terminal, run:
### `mongo`
### `use weather`
In a separate terminal session switch to the folder you've cloned the repository to.
Run:
### `npm i`
### `npm start`

The server should now be running at port 3000. Enjoy!
